When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevantto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not tobe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the oppositedirection.

Intelligence and large vocabularies are positivelycorrelated (Spearman, 1904). Therefore, by displaying a large vocabulary, one may beproviding cues that he or she is intelligent as well. Secondly, writers are assumed to beconforming to the Gricean maxim of manner, ‘avoid obscurity of expression’ (Grice,1975). If authors are believed to be writing as simply as possible, but a text is nonethelesscomplex, a reader might believe that the ideas expressed in that text are also complex,defying all attempts to simplify the language. Further, individuals forced to strugglethrough a complex text might experience dissonance if they believe that the ideas beingconveyed are simple (Festinger, 1957). Thus, individuals might be motivated to perceive adifﬁcult text as being more worthwhile, thereby justifying the effort of processing.Indeed, there is some evidence that complex vocabulary can be indicative of a moreintelligent author. For example, Pennebaker and King (1999) have shown that thepercentage of long words used in class assignments positively correlates with SATscores and exam grades on both multiple choice and essay tests. However it is difﬁcultto draw conclusions about the effectivenessof a strategy of complexity from this data.The study did not look at how readers of the texts containing the long words perceivedthe authors’ intelligence. Thus, it is possible that although students using complexvocabularies are objectively very knowledgeable, they might nonetheless be perceivedas being less so.Why might we believe that the experts might be correct in recommending simplicity inwriting? One theory that predicts the effectiveness of straightforward writing is that ofprocessing ﬂuency. Simpler writing is easier to process, and studies have demonstratedthat processing ﬂuency is associated with a variety of positive dimensions. Fluency leadsto higher judgements of truth (Reber & Schwarz, 1999), conﬁdence (Norwick & Epley,2002), frequency (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), fame (Jacoby, Kelley, Brown, &Jasechko, 1989), and even liking (Reber, Winkielman, & Schwarz, 1998). Furthermore,the effects of ﬂuency are strongest when the ﬂuency is discrepant—when the amount ofexperienced ﬂuency is surprising (Whittlesea & Williams, 2001a, 2001b). As such, itwould not be surprising if the lower ﬂuency of overly complex texts caused readers to havenegative evaluations of those texts and the associated authors, especially if the complexitywas unnecessary and thus surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.Both the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) iscorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-ity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss ofﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of thetext’s authors.EXPERIMENT 1Experiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing thecomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, towhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simplerwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss ofﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made morecomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurusentries.140D. M.
